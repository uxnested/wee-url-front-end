# Let's go through each folder and file:

* components/: This folder contains all the reusable components of your application. Each component should have its own folder, containing its TypeScript file and any related files.

* pages/: This folder contains all the pages of your application. As with the previous example, Next.js automatically generates routes based on the file system structure under this folder. Each page should have its own folder, containing its TypeScript file and any related files. Additionally, this folder contains the _app.tsx file, which is used to initialize the application.

* public/: This folder contains all the static assets of your application, such as images, fonts, and the favicon. These assets can be accessed directly from the client-side code.

* styles/: This folder contains all the CSS styles of your application. globals.css contains global styles that apply to the entire application, while tailwind.css contains the Tailwind CSS styles. You can also create additional CSS files for specific components or pages.

* types/: This folder contains all the TypeScript type definitions for your application. Each module should have its own TypeScript definition file, ending with the .d.ts extension.

* utils/: This folder contains all the utility functions and modules that are used throughout the application.

* package.json: This file contains the metadata and dependencies for your project.

* tsconfig.json: This file contains the TypeScript configuration for your project.
